# Supermarket
An online co-op game where you run a supermarket with your friends in different departments and work together to make goods! (Think Overcooked but with seperate unique kitchens that have dependencies on one another).

# Screenshots & Videos

# Built With
- [Unity](https://unity.com/)
- [Unity Netcode](https://unity.com/products/netcode)

# Features

- [Networked multiplayer using **Unity's Netcode API**](./Assets/Scripts/Character/PlayerInput.cs)
- [Multi-purpose item processing system (can be used for baking, kneading dough, and more)](./Assets/Scripts/Processor.cs)
- [An items system that makes efficient use of **ScriptableObjects**](./Assets/Scripts/Item.cs)
- [Pushable item containers (like the baking rack)](./Assets/Scripts/PushableItemContainer.cs)
- Fully functioning bakery department
- [Simple customer ordering system](./Assets/Scripts/Order.cs)

# Goals
- Add more departments (deli, seafood, floral, etc)
- Create better art for the project (right now it's all temporary dev art)
- Revamp customer spawner
- Add a way to obtain more supplies

# Plan
Supermarket is something I develop individually in my free time, so progress will move relatively slow. However, I really enjoy working on the project, so more changes are sure to come. 
I will continue to develop code for the game, and I also plan to learn Blender so I can make my own art for the game as well. 
Finally, I practice music production with Ableton in my free time, and would like to make the music for the game too.

# What I've Learned So Far
- I'd never made a networked multiplayer game before and really enjoyed learning how to use Unity's Netcode API.
- The difference between client-authoritative and server-authoritative as well as their respective pros and cons.
- What Remote Procedure Calls are and how they are meant to be used.
